Steps for completion
1. Make the mushroom duxelles. Place a medium sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the oil, and when hot, add the mushrooms. Season well with salt and pepper, and add the thyme. Stirring frequently to be sure the mushrooms don’t stick, cook until all the moisture has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool.
2. Make the chive crepes. In a large mixing bowl, combine eggs, flour, milk, chives, thyme, and salt. Whisk until incorporated. Transfer to the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
3. Lightly spray a 10-inch nonstick pan and place over low heat. Add ¼ cup batter to the pan and swirl the pan so the batter spreads evenly along the bottom into a very thin pancake. Let it cook for 25 to 30 seconds until set, then using an offset spatula to lift one side, flip and cook on the other side for just a few seconds. Work quickly because you don’t want any browning to occur. Remove the crepe to a plate. Continue making crepes until all the batter is used (this makes about 5 crepes). Place a square of parchment paper between the crepes so they don’t stick.
4. Make the Wellington. Season the beef liberally with salt and pepper on all sides, using your hands to press it in while rolling and shaping the beef to be cylindrical. Heat a cast-iron skillet, and add grapeseed oil to sear the beef, cooking 60 seconds per side. Remove the beef to a sheet tray and pour the juices from the pan over it. While it’s hot, brush Dijon mustard all over, then let it rest.
5. Moisten a cutting board with a damp towel. Layer three pieces of plastic wrap, overlapping one another on the board. Depending on the width of the tenderloin, take 2 to 3 pancakes and trim them into squares the length of the tenderloin, then line them up vertically on the plastic. Layer on the prosciutto slices. Spread the mushroom duxelles over the ham. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the resting juices from the beef over the mushrooms, then place the beef at the bottom of the crepe. Using the plastic wrap to lift as you pull the crepe over the beef, roll the beef up completely, smoothing the plastic and twisting the ends to form a tight package. Refrigerate for 20 minutes.
6. Preheat a convection oven to 425°F or a non-convection oven to 450°F.
7. Use a damp towel again to moisten the cutting board, then layer three pieces of plastic wrap. Place puff pastry in the center. Use a rolling pin or dowel to evenly roll out the dough to ⅛ inch thick, trimming if necessary to fit the beef. Unwrap the beef and place it on the pastry 1/3 of the way up. Lightly brush the pastry with an egg wash, and season with salt and pepper. Lift the plastic wrap up and roll the pastry over the beef, until the edges meet, then massage the pastry, smoothing it evenly across and sealing the seam. Twist the plastic, taking the excess pastry with it, until the pastry melts together, and cut off the ends. Unwrap the beef, discard the plastic, and smooth the ends, then brush with egg wash. Use the back of a knife to gently score the beef and create a decorative pattern. Season with more salt, place it on a parchment paper–lined tray, and insert a thyme sprig. Refrigerate for 5 minutes. Place the beef in the center of the oven and bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until golden brown. Remove and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
